## Overview of the Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to assess the credit risk of loan applicants using different machine learning models. Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. In this assignment, we analyzed lending data using Logistic Regression model and oversampling technique to predict whether a borrower will be able to pay back a loan.
